* Terraform Cloud Management

This repo houses my ever-growing collection of Terraform modules to manage GitHub, AWS, Digital Ocean, and so on.

By using IaC everywhere, you are never configuring cloud providers: you are developing a modular and reusable resource for GitOps, MLOps, DevOps...and you're saving your hair. Clicking through GUIs, yeck.

Each folder contains a readme to describe how to apply the scripts.

** Environmental Variables

Terraform will grab variables defined in `.tfvars` or `.bash_profile`. I couldn't get it to read from a `.env` file. Eventually I'm sure I'll want it to read SSH keys automatically.
